For example, you could create an abstract class that defines the methods that users need to access, but hides the implementation details of those methods. This would prevent users from being able to directly access the sensitive data that is used by those methods.\n",

    "#  13. What is data hiding, and why is it important in encapsulation? Provide examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data hiding, also known as encapsulation, is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that involves bundling data and methods together into a single unit called an object. The key principle behind data hiding is to restrict direct access to an object's internal data from outside the object itself. This is achieved by making the data private or protected within the class, and providing public methods to access and modify the data in a controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of Data Hiding in Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Protection of Data: \n",
    "    Data hiding ensures that the internal state of an object remains protected from accidental or malicious modifications by external code. By restricting direct access to data, it prevents unauthorized changes that could potentially compromise the integrity of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enforced Abstraction:\n",
    "    Data hiding helps enforce abstraction by hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world. This allows you to change the internal representation of data without affecting the way clients interact with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Improved Modularity:\n",
    "    Encapsulation promotes modularity by grouping related data and methods together. This makes it easier to understand and maintain the code, as changes to the internal implementation of an object do not affect the rest of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Enhanced Security:\n",
    "    Data hiding can enhance security by restricting access to sensitive data. By making data private or protected, you can control who can access and modify it, reducing the risk of unauthorized data breaches.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Increased complexity:\n",
    "    Encapsulation can make your code more complex, as you need to create classes and interfaces to define the abstractions. This can make it more difficult to understand and maintain your code, especially if you are not familiar with object-oriented programming.\n",
    "- Reduced performance:\n",
    "    Encapsulation can also reduce the performance of your code, as it adds an extra layer of indirection. This is because when you call a method on an object, the method is actually executed on the underlying implementation class. This can result in a performance overhead, especially if the underlying implementation class is complex.\n",
    "- Limited flexibility:\n",
    "    Encapsulation can limit the flexibility of your code, as it forces you to use the interfaces and classes that you have defined. This can make it difficult to extend or modify your code in the future, as you may need to change the underlying implementation classes.\n",
    "- Increased development time:\n",
    "    Encapsulation can also increase the development time of your code, as you need to create classes and interfaces to define the abstractions. This can be a significant investment of time, especially if you are not familiar with object-oriented programming.\n",
    "- Potential for misuse:\n",
    "    Encapsulation can also be misused, as it can be used to hide code that is not well-written or that is not intended to be used by other developers. This can make it difficult to understand and maintain your code, and it can also lead to security vulnerabilities."
